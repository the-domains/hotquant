# Agility: Conduct Business In Real Time
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fe4545f1-111b-4325-84ff-15de369d06c6.jpg)

A trader wants to exercise a strategy on a new security. He wants to buy it NOW.

But first Portfolio Oversight needs to approve the security for the trading strategy. And Compliance needs to check it for conflicts. And the order won't go through until Data Management populates your Order Management System with current market data... the RIGHT current market data.

Opportunities get lost this way.

HotQuant engineers Enterprise Data Management systems that integrate people as well as data. We connect traders, data stewards, oversight, and management into seamless workflows that transform irritating paper drills into well-orchestrated speed drills and run in a web browser.

Pass the ball, not the buck.
