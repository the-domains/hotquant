# Economy: Reduce Your Data Costs

Your top-secret bond indicator requires three numbers from Bloomberg.

One of them changes every time your traders ask. The second only changes quarterly, though, and the third is fixed over the life of the bond... but odds are that when a trader updates his indicator, you pull all three values from Bloomberg, every time.

That's expensive!

HotQuant engineers Enterprise Data Management systems that know when values change and manage requests so as to maximize savings without compromising data integrity or availability. Calculating that indicator a dozen times a day means about 9,000 individual data requests per year. With EDM in place: about 3,000\. That's a 2/3 reduction in annual market data costs for ONE system.

That's smart, and the savings go straight to your bottom line.
