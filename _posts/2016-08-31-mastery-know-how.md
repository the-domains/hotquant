# Mastery: Know How

Getting there is only half the battle.

Training your new Enterprise Data Management team on the job while they re-engineer your core systems is a frightening proposition. Outside experts may do brilliant work and carry great liability insurance, but they leave your team in possession of a shiny black box and few options but to return to the well whenever requirements change. This gets expensive fast.

We train and mentor your developers as they implement your solution, leveraging their capacity while extending their skills. When we go, we leave behind a deeply functional system composed of bulletproof design patterns and a crack Enterprise Data Management team equipped with the confidence and the skills to extend them however your future requires.

There's just no substitute for knowing how.
