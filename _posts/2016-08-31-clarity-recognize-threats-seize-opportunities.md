# Clarity: Recognize Threats, Seize Opportunities

Things break.

Sometimes it's obvious. But sometimes the cause is distant: on another platform. On another floor. On the opposite end of your system diagram. Sometimes it's subtle. And sometimes you only know there's a break once you crunch the numbers.

We crunch the numbers continuously.

HotQuant engineers Enterprise Data Management systems that define exceptional conditions in business terms and detect them in data terms. We connect first responders with the problem and management with the big picture via custom dashboards that reflect your business processes, enable an active response, and run in a web browser.

First see. Then do.
