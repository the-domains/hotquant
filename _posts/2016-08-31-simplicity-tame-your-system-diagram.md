Simplicity: Tame Your System Diagram
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f711a9d0-1de3-4cfd-98d8-df7ea8c5fa64.jpg)

As your business grew, so did your system.

Order entry, routing, matching & execution; data cleansing, warehousing, analysis & reporting; back office, front office, the trading floor and the exchange floor: every function a box on a diagram connected to everything else via web service, message queue, file drop, and e-mail. Fed by dozens of overlapping data sources. Serving hundreds of time-critical reporting clients. Overseen by Legal, Accounting, Compliance, and the executive suite. Ruled by the iron fist of your customer's bottom line.

It's complicated.

HotQuant reduces complexity by radically transforming your system diagram: instead of connecting with each other for data, the elements of your system connect with an Enterprise Data Management hub. We receive data in whatever shape your sources can provide, transform and canonicalize your data in ways that are most meaningful for your business, and then deliver the high-quality product in precisely the form your targets require.

The result? Your business, simplified.
